JUST TO GAUGE the reaction amongst my peers to the Ifawn, I figured I'd give a few of my buddies in the States a call. Here in tres chic Paris, we haven't really been exposed to the full force of the Apple hype machine since the mobile won't be out here until 2008, in all likelihood. But even the buzz here on the streets suggests that l'Iphone could be rather a big thing.
So I got on my, rather standard, phone and called a few buddies. "Hey!" says one - who I'll call Jim for today - as I catch him on a morning coffee break, thanks to the time difference. "Guess what you're talking to me on?" he enthusiastically bellows down the phone, in that very Silicon Valley way, leaving me little doubt as to what exactly I'm speaking to him on. "Let me guess, I'm on with Iphone, right?" My voice betrays no small amount of envy. "Sure thing buddy! This thing is awesome! I've been loading up music and contacts all morning, setting up my email. It's the neatest thing ever! Say, when's it out your neck of the woods?"
